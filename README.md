# TODO :

Here are some elements of my workflow/setup that I want to improve during my next review of my Nvim/Tmux configuration:

- [ ] Tmux: Ability to access error links (path + line) directly in Neovim (opens in the panel with Neovim if open, otherwise creates a panel with Neovim and access to the file).
- [ ] Nvim: Disable Notify/Noice or find a less annoying way to display popups.
- [ ] Nvim: Configure the debugger.
- [ ] Nvim: Remove unnecessary plugins.
- [ ] Nvim: Make auto-pairs work.
- [ ] Nvim: Document all <leader> commands with which key.
- [ ] Nvim: Have a functional configuration for CSS/SCSS.
- [ ] Nvim: Set up aliases or review my git/merge git workflow.
- [ ] Nvim: Review the configuration of cmp and luasnip --> Too many duplicates, suggests unnecessary tags in TSX (useMem --> <useMem></useMem>).
